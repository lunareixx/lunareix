# Hello, I'm Raihan!

### Just an ordinary undergraduate computer science guy who want to learn code.

I currently a second-year student majoring in Computer Science at IPB University. My primary interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Blockchain Development.

My passion for technology has been growing since I was 6 years old and that was when I tried installing my some apps on my dad's laptop. From then on, I would often operate my dad's laptop and also started tinkering with other tech stuff. Maybe that's why I chose this computer science major.

**Advancing Technology for Humanity.**


### I really like music :headphones:
